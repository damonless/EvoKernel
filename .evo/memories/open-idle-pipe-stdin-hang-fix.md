## Symptom
Subprocesses (evo hook stop, antigravity_hook.mjs) hang indefinitely when spawned with non-TTY open idle stdin pipe

## Root Cause
Synchronous fs.readFileSync(0, 'utf8') in resolvePayload and readStdinJson blocked indefinitely on open idle pipes with 0 bytes written

## Solution
Replaced blocking pipe read with non-blocking 50ms timeout stream and guarded sync reads to regular files only
